### Human-Centered Design + Rapid Prototyping = Solutions for Humans

Our work was completed in seven working sessions over three weeks. When you’re moving as quickly as we did, it’s important to bring a diverse team together to quickly build trust and create common ground. To do so, we held a **project kickoff** as our first iteration of the application. Our team of product managers, technologists, consultants, user experience experts, designers, storytellers, and researchers came together for an intense day of collaboration, ideas, and emotions.

We worked closely throughout the project, using a human-centered design approach focused on **identifying user needs as a starting point to product development.** Our iterative process involved rapid prototyping and can be divided into four phases: __LEARN, IDEATE, MAKE, and CHECK__.

# Defining the Challenge
![Section Learn](images/Step-Learn-H.png)


We kicked off the project by establishing ground rules and going over the requirements of the competition. Once goals were defined, we brainstormed about target audiences and what would provide value in a Visioning Session, which was designed like a Mad Lib:

___I am a `target user` who needs `insert needs` so that I can `emotional benefit.` This form is different because `key differentiator.`___


![Mad Libs](images/Mad-libs.png)

The Visioning Session resulted in two project charters and a challenge brief that defined our area for experimentation around user needs. Our two target audiences were school administrators and parents.

Below is an image of the Challenge Brief that we created to align on our scope, constraints, target users, and expected outcomes. The Challenge brief can change as we learn more from our prototypes.

Once we defined what we were making, we drafted assumptions that we planned to test in our research. Assumption testing focuses on identifying the parts of our concept that we think are essential.

# Building Empathy
![Section Learn](images/Step-Learn-H.png)

Armed with our hypotheses and existing knowledge, we created a journey map for the parent and the school administrator. The map resulted in the identification of pain points, areas where design and engineering could come together to improve the user experience. We journey map because we tend to misjudge what users want. Journey mapping gets us closer to user problems and frustrations. Below is what the current state journey map looked like for the school administrator and parent:

Next, we created the first draft of our personas, or characterizations that represent end users. We split into two teams and sketched personas, which enabled us to generate ideas that would meet the needs of the users. We created Run-down Ronaldo, a single dad who is trying to raise a family on little income, and Frazzled Phyllis, a school administrator that is over-worked and short on time. Establishing personas at this phase of the project ensures that we are creating a solution for our end-users.

Most of the population that we were designing for were using mobile devices to access the internet. We used Bootstrap to develop our solution because it provided a robust grid system and pre-styled HTML elements that enabled us to quickly and effectively make a website that is responsive to multiple devices.

# Generating Ideas from Insights
![Section Ideate](images/Step-Ideate-H.png)

**Why are people misreporting? How can we encourage accurate reporting?**
We set up our brainstorming session so that we could break away from groupthink. We divided into three teams and brainstormed, using our Challenge Brief and Personas to inspires ideas. Our ideation session had both technical input from our development team, design input from our designers, client input from a subject matter expert who had worked with USDA, as well as product and user input. 

![Brainstorm](images/sketching.png)
Our small groups presented each of their concepts to the larger team and continued our brainstorm by externalizing ideas on the wall using sticky notes. After discussing the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches, we decided to make two versions of the website design: a Wizard and a Single Scroll.
