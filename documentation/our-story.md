## Human-Centered Design and Rapid Prototyping: Solutions for Humans
Our work was completed in seven working sessions over three weeks. When you’re moving as quickly as we did, it’s important to bring a diverse team together to quickly build trust and create common ground. To do so, we held a **project kickoff** as our first iteration of the application. Our team of product managers, technologists, consultants, user experience experts, designers, storytellers, and researchers came together for an intense day of collaboration, ideas, and emotions.

We used a human-centered design approach focused on learning fast through rapid prototyping. Our iterative process can be divided into four phases: **LEARN, IDEATE, MAKE, and CHECK**.

##LEARN: Defining the challenge

We kicked off the day by establishing ground rules and going over the requirements of the competition. With our goals in mind, we brainstormed target audiences and what would provide value to said audience in what we call a Visioning Session. The session was designed like a mad lib:

___I am a `target users` who needs `insert needs` so that I can `emotional benefit.` This form is different because `key differentiator.`__

The Visioning Session resulted in two project charters and a challenge brief that defined our area for experimentation.

Here’s the Challenge Brief that we created to align on our scope, constraints, target users, and expected outcomes. The Challenge brief can change as we learn more from our prototypes.

Once we defined what it was we were making we drafted assumptions that we planned to test in our research. Assumption testing focuses on identifying the parts of our concept that we think are essential.

##LEARN: Building empathy for the user’s current experience

Armed with our hypotheses and existing knowledge, we created a journey map for the parent and the school administrator. The map resulted in the identification of pain points, areas where design and engineering could come together to improve the user experience. We journey map because we tend to misjudge what users want. Journey mapping gets us closer to user problems and frustrations. Here is what the current state journey map looked like for the school administrator and parent:

Next, we created the first draft of our *personas*. We split into two teams and sketched personas, which enabled us to generate ideas that would meet the needs of the users. We created Run-down Ronaldo, the single dad who is trying to pay rent and Frazzled Phyllis, the school administrator that is stretched thin. Establishing personas at this phase of the project ensures that we are creating a solution for our end-users.

We knew that our population we were designing for most often using *mobile devices* to access the internet. We used *Bootstrap* to design our solution because it enables us to make a website that is responsible and saves us time on pre-styling for HTML elements. The robust grid system sets us up for success on a variety of devices.
